**Digital Twin–Based Battery Management System for Sodium-Ion Batteries**
This repository presents a Digital Twin–enabled Battery Management System (BMS) for Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries, integrating Simulink-based modeling, advanced state estimation, multiphysics coupling, and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) analysis.

**Project Objectives:**

1.Develop a physics-informed digital twin for a Sodium-ion battery.

2.Estimate State of Charge (SOC) using Adaptive EKF.

3.Estimate State of Health (SOH) using resistance-based degradation modeling.

4.Estimate State of Energy (SOE) for energy availability tracking.

5.Perform long-term RUL prediction using MATLAB-based analysis.

6.Enable future COMSOL–Simulink LiveLink integration for multiphysics enhancement.
